        <h2>4. User Rights and Controls</h2>
        <p>You have certain rights regarding your personal data. Please note that some rights may be subject to limitations based on technical feasibility or legal requirements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Access and Correction:</b> You can access and update certain information associated with your Meta account directly through your Meta Quest device settings. For any game-specific data that is not accessible through Meta's tools, please contact us using the information below.</li>

Please note that deleting your data may result in the loss of your game progress and achievements. Meta also provides tools to delete your Meta account and associated data.</li>
            <li><b>Privacy Settings:</b> You have control over various privacy settings on your Meta Quest device, including:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Microphone Access:</b> You can enable or disable microphone access for the Game through your device settings.</li>

        <h2>6. Additional Considerations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Children's Privacy:</b> Our Game is intended for a general audience and is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information as quickly as possible. We encourage parents and guardians to monitor their children's online activities and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide personal information through the Game without their permission.</li>
            <li><b>Data Retention:</b> We retain your data for as long as necessary to provide you with the Game and its features, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. The specific retention period will depend on the type of data and the purpose for which it was collected. For instance, gameplay progress data may be retained as long as you have an active account, while anonymized analytics data may be retained for longer periods for research and improvement purposes.</li>
            <li><b>Changes to this Privacy Policy:</b> We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the updated Privacy Policy on the Meta Store page for our Game and/or through in-game notifications. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the Game after any changes indicates your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</li>
